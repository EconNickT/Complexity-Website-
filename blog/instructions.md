# Blog Management Instructions

## Quick Start: Adding a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Create Your Post File

1. Copy `/blog/_template.html` to a new file with a descriptive URL-friendly name:
   ```
   /blog/your-post-title.html
   ```
   Examples: `network-analysis-intro.html`, `abm-trading-simulation.html`

2. Edit the new file and update these sections:
   - **Title & Meta Description** (lines 6-7)
   - **Post Title** (line 85)
   - **Post Metadata** (lines 89-101): Date, read time, category
   - **Post Tags** (lines 105-109)
   - **Content Body** (starting at line 120)

### Step 2: Add Post Card to Blog Index

1. Open `/blog/index.html`
2. Find the blog card section (around line 210)
3. Copy this template and paste it with your other posts:

```html
<div class="blog-card" data-category="YOUR_CATEGORY">
    <div class="blog-image YOUR_CATEGORY">
        <i class="fas fa-YOUR-ICON"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-content">
        <h3><a href="/blog/your-post-url.html">Your Post Title</a></h3>
        <div class="blog-meta">
            <div class="meta-item">
                <i class="fas fa-calendar"></i>
                <span>Oct 2, 2025</span>
            </div>
            <div class="meta-item">
                <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
                <span>5 min read</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="blog-excerpt">
            Write a compelling 2-3 sentence excerpt that makes people want to read more.
        </p>
        <div class="blog-tags">
            <span class="tag">Tag1</span>
            <span class="tag">Tag2</span>
        </div>
        <a href="/blog/your-post-url.html" class="read-more">
            Read More <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
```

4. Replace `YOUR_CATEGORY` with one of: `complexity`, `network`, `market`, or `research`
5. Replace `YOUR-ICON` with appropriate FontAwesome icon (see Icon Guide below)

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Commit both files to your repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy

## Content Writing Tips

### Structure Your Post

1. **Opening Hook** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Start with a question, surprising fact, or relevant anecdote
   - Explain why this topic matters

2. **Main Content** (3-5 sections with H2 headers)
   - Break complex ideas into digestible chunks
   - Use subsections (H3) for detailed points
   - Include code examples, lists, or images where helpful

3. **Conclusion** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Summarize key takeaways
   - End with action items or questions for reflection

### Use Content Elements

**Lists:** Great for key points, steps, or features
```html
<ul>
    <li>First point with explanation</li>
    <li>Second point with explanation</li>
</ul>
```

**Callout Boxes:** Highlight important information
```html
<div class="callout info">
    <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Key Insight</h4>
    <p>Your important point here.</p>
</div>
```

Available callout types:
- `.callout.info` (blue) - Insights, explanations
- `.callout.warning` (yellow) - Caveats, limitations
- `.callout.success` (green) - Results, achievements

**Code Blocks:** For any code examples
```html
<div class="code-block">
import pandas as pd
# Your code here
</div>
```

**Images:** Add visual interest (use placeholders or real images)
```html
<div class="post-image">
    <img src="path/to/image.png" alt="Description">
    <p class="image-caption">Figure 1: Your caption</p>
</div>
```

**Blockquotes:** For emphasis or notable quotes
```html
<blockquote>
    "Your memorable quote or key statement here."
</blockquote>
```

## Estimating Read Time

Use this rough guide:
- **150-200 words per minute** is average reading speed
- Count your words, divide by 175
- Round up to nearest minute
- Add 1-2 minutes if you have complex code or dense technical content

Examples:
- 875 words ≈ 5 min read
- 1,400 words ≈ 8 min read
- 2,100 words ≈ 12 min read

---

## File Organization

Keep your blog organized:

```
/blog/
├── index.html              # Main blog listing page
├── _template.html          # Template for new posts (DON'T EDIT except to improve template)
├── _INSTRUCTIONS.md        # This file
├── example-post.html       # Full example showing all features
├── your-first-post.html    # Your actual posts
├── your-second-post.html
└── images/                 # Optional: folder for blog images
    ├── post-1-figure.png
    └── post-2-chart.png
```

## Best Practices

### SEO & Discoverability

- Use descriptive, keyword-rich titles
- Write compelling meta descriptions (150-160 characters)
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Add alt text to all images
- Include internal links to your projects when relevant

### Writing Style

- **Be conversational but professional**
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Break up long paragraphs (aim for 3-4 sentences max)
- Use **bold** for emphasis, not italics or ALL CAPS

### Mobile-Friendly

- Keep paragraphs short
- Use lists and callouts to break up text
- Test on mobile before publishing
- Avoid overly wide code blocks (they'll scroll horizontally)

### Quality Over Quantity

- It's better to publish one excellent post than three mediocre ones
- Aim for 1,000-2,000 words for substantive posts
- Shorter posts (500-800 words) are fine for tutorials or quick insights
- Always proofread before publishing

## Troubleshooting

### Post Not Appearing on Index Page

**Problem:** Added card to index.html but post doesn't show
**Solution:** 
1. Check that `data-category` matches one of: complexity, network, market, research
2. Verify the href link matches your actual filename
3. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Broken Links

**Problem:** Clicking post title gives 404 error
**Solution:**
1. Verify file is in `/blog/` directory
2. Check filename matches exactly (case-sensitive!)
3. Ensure file has `.html` extension
4. Wait a minute for Cloudflare Pages to deploy

### Formatting Issues

**Problem:** Content looks weird or unstyled
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you copied the full template
2. Check that all HTML tags are properly closed
3. Validate HTML at https://validator.w3.org if needed

### Filter Not Working

**Problem:** Category filter buttons don't filter posts
**Solution:**
1. Ensure `data-category` attribute is set on the `.blog-card` div
2. Category value must match exactly: complexity, network, market, or research
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Advanced: Customizing the Template

### Adding a New Category

If you want to add a category beyond the four provided:

1. **Add gradient to `/blog/index.html`** (in `<style>` section):
```css
.blog-image.yourcategory {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #COLOR1 0%, #COLOR2 100%);
}
```

2. **Add filter button**:
```html
<button class="filter-btn" onclick="filterPosts('yourcategory')">Your Category</button>
```

3. **Use in blog cards**:
```html
<div class="blog-card" data-category="yourcategory">
    <div class="blog-image yourcategory">
```

### Adding Series/Multi-Part Posts

Add navigation between related posts:

```html
<div class="callout info">
    <h4><i class="fas fa-list"></i> This is Part 2 of a 3-Part Series</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="/blog/part-1.html">← Part 1: Introduction</a> | 
        <a href="/blog/part-3.html">Part 3: Advanced Topics →</a>
    </p>
</div>
```

### Adding Table of Contents

For longer posts, add a TOC at the beginning:

```html
<div class="callout info">
    <h4><i class="fas fa-list"></i> Table of Contents</h4>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!-- Then add id attributes to your H2 headings -->
<h2 id="section1">Section 1 Title</h2>
```
